This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Go to this link to view the live version of this application: 

If you want to pull the code locally:
The .env file will need 2 heroku databases(cloud), OR a database that has permissions for creating a new database.

First, install local dependencies:
```
npm install
```

To seed prisma, run migration, and view your database interaction run these commands in order 
```bash

npx prisma db seed

npx prisma migrate dev

npx prisma studio

```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## First Nextjs project ever
To start this project I first familiarized myself with the [official Nextjs tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs)

## First Prisma.io project ever
Implementing Prisma was an absolute joy. Super easy, and was able to follow their docs to do exactly what I wanted to accomplish.

### Throughput
Day of receiving the project: March 25, 2022

I worked on the project primarily Mon-Fri between the hours of 8am and 12pm MDT (I estimate roughly 10-15 hours a week). 

I believe the estimated total time on this project took about 20-30 hours of labor.
